# Projects
Notable C++ projects I created in CS128 
These Include the Seam Carver Application and the Word Search Solver. The Seam Carver application takes ppm files and finds the seams of the image with the least amount of energy and crops them from the image using optimization techniques such as Dynamic Programming.
